## What files can it bundle to become `d.ts`?

- [x] Normal `.ts`, `.tsx` files
- [x] `.vue` files, using `@vue/compiler-sfc`
- [x] `.svelte` files, using `svelte2tsx`
- [x] `.astro` files, using `@astrojs/compiler`
- [x] `.vine.ts` files, using `@vue-vine/compiler`

All special files can be disabled by options, just set like `vue: false`, `svelte: false`, etc.

> I will keep the configuration as simple as possible, just like tsup ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install undts
```

Create a file in your project root directory:

```js
import { build } from 'undts'

build({
  entry: [
    // Add your entry files here
    './src/index.ts'
  ],

  // ... more options, you can see jsdoc in the source code
})
```

Then run this file with `node`/`tsx`/`ts-node`, for example:

```bash
pnpx tsx your-file.ts
```

It will generate d.ts file in `dist` directory by default. You can change the output directory by `outDir` option:

```js
build({
  entry: ['./src/index.ts'],
  outDir: './types', // default is './dist'
})
```

## Plugin

`undts`'s plugin system is extended from `rollup` and added some new hooks, you can use it to customize the behavior of `undts`.

- `dtsConfig`: This hook is called when starting call `build` function, you can modify the `undts`'s configuration by this hook.
- `transformInclude`: This hook is called when `undts` encounters a file that needs to be included in the cache bundle, you can use this hook to modify the file content before it is included in the cache bundle.
- `transformCallExpression`: This hook is called when `undts` encounters a TypeScript `CallExpression` node, the main purpose of this hook is to convert the `import()` function.
- `transformImportDeclaration/transformExportDeclaration`: These hooks are called when `undts` encounters a TypeScript `ImportDeclaration`/`ExportDeclaration` node, the main purpose of these hooks is to convert the `import`/`export` statement.
- `transformSourceFile`: This hook is called when `undts` encounters a TypeScript `SourceFile` instance, this hook will be called after all of the above hooks have been called.
- `writeCacheBundle`: This hook is called when `undts` writes the cache bundle to the disk, you can use this hook to modify the cache bundle before it is written to the disk. It enabled `bundled` option (default is enabled), the real cache bundle path will be delivered to `rollup`'s `input` option and transform by `rollup-plugin-dts` plugin.
